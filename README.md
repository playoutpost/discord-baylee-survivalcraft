  ## About v0.1

  Baylee is based on a bot I originally created for my Minecraft server, SurvivalCraft (now called [The Outpost](https://playoutpost.com)). This version of Baylee is one of the earliest versions built exclusively for the Minecraft server. v0.1 is poorly documented, poorly written, hasn't been updated in a few years.
