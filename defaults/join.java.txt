:point_right::skin-tone-1: **want to join?**
joining is super simple, just send me a message and say apply. i'll walk you through the application and it should only take about a minute.

after approval you will have access to two of our java servers

:sunrise_over_mountains:  **what is the vanilla server?**
like hermitcraft, this is the basic minecraft survival experience with classic nether hub and large scale community builds.

:sunrise: **what is the vanilla plus server?**
we've enhanced the survival experience with safe trading, warps, and custom villages. it's a new server, so there may be bugs.

:gear: **change your settings**
you customize your experience here like hiding chats. to get started, send me a message and say settings

:shield: **meet your moderators**
